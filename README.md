# BattleShips

## About
BattleShips is my first attempt to make an online game. It is a copy of the pen and pencil game called BattleShips, in Czech known as 'LodÄ›'. 
Currently it's work in progress.

## Requirements
You need python version 3.9 and pygame installed. 
For running the game you will need to be on the same local network as the server is, but internet access is not needed.
You can also have the server on a different network, but I haven't tested it yet.

## Running
You need to start exactly one server instance and then you can start as many clients as you wish.
```cmd
ServerMain.py
BattleShips.py
BattleShips.py
BattleShips.py
```
